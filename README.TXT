Converto is a HTML and JAVASCRIPT online kitchen converter.

I intend this to be a stand alone application.  Any browser with javascript can
read this and use it. It is implemented as a simple static web page.

There will be no calls to an outside server.

It is implemented as a simple form that returns the needed conversion.

I wish to use JAVASCRIPT's session storage for storing values temporarily to make the
program work.

Wish me luck! :D

Converto is also free to use.
I will release this under an artistic license.
